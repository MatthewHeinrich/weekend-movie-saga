# Movie Gallery Project
===

## Description
===
This application displays a list of movies added to a database by the user. The user can click on the 'Add Movie' button and is then brought to a seperate page to add the movie title, poster URL, genre and description of any given movie. Once submitted, they are brought back to the home page where the movies are displayed on cards. The details button on each card brings them to a page with all selected generes, the poster and the description of the selected movie.
